This is a POC:

Step 1 - looks for EXE files in current folder, if there is one then we will get the path & name of exe file.
step 2 - Using the Exe name & path we extract the Bytecode files.
step 3 - We then find the relevant bytecode file as there will be alot and after picking up the right one we  decompile it.
Step 4 - Out put the source code(Shown in terminal)
